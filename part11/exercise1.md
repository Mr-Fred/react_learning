For a Python application in active development with a 6-person team, a robust CI setup is crucial.

For **linting**, tools like `Flake8` (which combines `Pyflakes` for static analysis and `pycodestyle` for PEP 8 compliance) and `Black` are widely used. `Black` can even be integrated into a pre-commit hook to ensure consistent formatting. 

For **testing**, `pytest` is the de facto standard. It's a powerful and flexible testing framework that supports unit, integration, and functional tests. `Pytest-cov` can be added for test coverage reporting. 

While "building" in Python often refers to packaging rather than compilation, tools like `setuptools` are used to create distributable packages (e.g., wheels) which can be an artifact of the CI pipeline.

Beyond Jenkins and GitHub Actions, several strong alternatives exist for CI. 

**GitLab CI/CD** is a popular choice, as it's tightly integrated. **CircleCI** is another widely used cloud-based CI/CD platform known for its ease of setup and comprehensive integrations. 
**Travis CI** and **Bitbucket Pipelines** are also viable options. 
For teams preferring more control or on-premises solutions, **TeamCity** by JetBrains offers a powerful CI/CD server.

The decision between a self-hosted or cloud-based CI environment depends on various factors. For this specific scenario, a 
**cloud-based environment would likely be better**. With a team of 6 and an application nearing release, the focus should be on rapid iteration and deployment.

Cloud-based CI/CD services offer zero infrastructure overhead, immediate scalability, and often a pay-as-you-go model. This allows the team to concentrate on development and shipping the product. Self-hosting would introduce the burden of server provisioning, maintenance, security updates, and ensuring high availability.

To make a definitive decision on self-hosted vs. cloud-based, the following information would be needed:
* **Budget:** Cloud services have ongoing costs.
* **Compliance Requirements:**
* **Security Policies:**
* **Team Expertise:** with managing infrastructure.
* **Future Growth Projections:**
